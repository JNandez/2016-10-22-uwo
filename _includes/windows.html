Please go through all the installation steps below and make sure that
you not only installed them, but start them up to make sure they're working.
If you have any problems, don't hesitate to email the instructors to
ask for help, or arrive early on the first day of the workshop to
get help.

<li><b>R</b>
<br>In the workshop, we will use RStudio. RStudio is a nice interface to the
programming language R. To use RStudio, you need to install both R and RStudio.
<ul>
<li>      Download R from
      <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/release.htm">here</a>
<li>Run the .exe file that was just downloaded
<li>Go to the <a href="http://www.rstudio.com/ide/download/desktop">RStudio Download page</a>
<li>Under <i>Installers</i> select <b>RStudio 0.98.1103 - Windows XP/Vista/7/8</b>
<li>Double click the file to install it
<li>Once it's installed, open RStudio to make sure it works and you don't get any error messages.
</ul>

<p>

<li><b>Python</b>
<br>
  <a href=http://python.org/>Python</a> is a popular language for scientific computing, and great for general-purpose programming as well. 
Installing all of its scientific packages individually can be a bit difficult, so we recommend <a href=https://www.continuum.io/anaconda>Anaconda</a>, 
an all-in-one installer.

Regardless of how you choose to install it, <b>please make sure you install Python version 3.x</b> (e.g., 3.4 is fine). 

  We will teach Python using the <a href=http://jupyter.org/>jupyter notebook</a>, a programming environment that runs in a web browser. 
For this to work you will need a reasonably up-to-date browser. The current versions of the Chrome, Safari and 
Firefox browsers are all <a href=http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/2/install/install.html#browser-compatibility>supported</a> (some older browsers, including Internet Explorer version 9 and below, are not).

<ul>
  <li> Download and install <a href=https://www.continuum.io/anaconda>Anaconda</a>. 
<li> Download the default Python 3 installer. Use all of the defaults for installation except make sure to check <b>Make Anaconda the default Python</b>. 
</ul>
</ol>
