Please go through all the installation steps below and make sure that
you not only installed them, but start them up to make sure they're working.
If you have any problems, don't hesitate to email the instructors to
ask for help, or arrive early on the first day of the workshop to
get help.

    <li><b>R</b>
    <br>In the workshop, we will use RStudio. RStudio is a nice interface to the
    programming language R. To use RStudio, you need to install both R and RStudio.
    <ul>
      <li>Follow the instructions for your distribution
	from <a href="https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/linux/" target="_blank">CRAN</a>. For most distributions, you
	can use your package manager (e.g. for Debian/Ubuntu run <code>sudo
	apt-get install r-base</code>, and for Fedora run <code>sudo yum install
	R</code>) but make sure that you have at least R 3.2.2 (as pre-packaged
	versions might be out of date).
      <li>To install RStudio, go to
	the <a href="http://www.rstudio.com/ide/download/desktop" target="_blank">RStudio Download
	  page</a>
      <li>Under <i>Installers</i> select the version for your distribution.
      <li>Once it's downloaded, double click the file to install it (or <code>sudo dpkg
	  -i rstudio-x.yy.zzz-amd64.deb</code> at the terminal).
      <li>Once it's installed, open RStudio to make sure it works and you don't get any error messages.
    </ul>

<p>

  <li><b>Python</b>
    <br>
   <ul>   
	   <li> Open <a href=http://continuum.io/downloads target="_blank">Anaconda</a> with your web browser.
    <li> Download the Python 3 installer for Linux.
    <li> Install Python 3 using all of the defaults for installation. (Installation requires using the shell. If you aren't comfortable doing the installation yourself stop here and request help at the workshop.)
    Open a terminal window.
    Type
    <pre>bash Anaconda3-</pre>
    and then press tab. The name of the file you just downloaded should appear.
    Press enter. You will follow the text-only prompts. When there is a colon at the bottom of the screen press the down arrow to move down through the text. Type yes and press enter to approve the license. Press enter to approve the default location for the files. Type yes and press enter to prepend Anaconda to your PATH (this makes the Anaconda distribution the default Python).
  </ul>
